# Computational Resource for "Promise and Limitations" Paper


This directory contains code and scripts to generate and analyze simulation data used in the paper "Probabilistic Colocalization Analysis: Promise and Limitations" by Hukku et al. The code and scripts  are organized in the subdirectories corresponding to different sections in the paper.

Due to the NIH policy regarding privacy of genetic data, we are not allowed to distribute real genotype data from the GTEx project (used in simulations of allelic heterogeneity and empirical power evaluation). The genotype data from the GUEVADIS project (used in simulations of LD mismatching) are publicly available.
